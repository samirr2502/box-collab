# This Version
* Still under development. There are some bugs that need to be fixed

# Usage
If you want to clone this repo, for now, you need to get your own secret key and developer token from the Box Developer portal
You can use the app only to log in right now, but eventually the other services will be working:
* Get collaborators
* Get items in folder
* Remove Collaboratos in folder tree
